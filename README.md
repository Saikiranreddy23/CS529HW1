### Introduction: 
The Homework highlights the notion that data and data visualization are not neutral but are influenced by the intentions and choices of those who collect and present the data.

### My Homework Overview
In the process of refining this visualization, I've made several key improvements. First and foremost, I adjusted the color palette to a blue hue to ensure it's more accessible, especially to individuals with color blindness. Additionally, I revamped the color scheme applied to states, which now represents gun deaths per 1 million population, providing a more informative and nuanced perspective on the data.

Moreover, while fine-tuning the tooltips for each state and city, I aimed to enhance the overall user experience. These tooltips now offer insightful details about the dataset, offering a clearer picture of the gun death statistics. Furthermore, I introduced a meaningful addition to the visualization â€“ a bar graph displaying the count of gun deaths categorized by gender for each state. This bar graph comes complete with tooltips, providing users with in-depth information to better understand the distribution of gun deaths across males and females within each state.
